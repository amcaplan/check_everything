This file contains your favorite websites!  I've included some samples,
but you should change this and make it your own.

Tags start with "&&" whereas websites are prefaced with "--".  For your
convenience, tags are case-insensitive, as I have illustrated.  Each
website must have its own line.

You can use multiple tags separated by semicolons (;) to assign websites
to multiple groups.  Anything marked with the "default" tag will open if
no tags are specified.  In the sample list, the program will by default
open the "NEWS" and "EMAIL" groups.

Put your websites down here (and don't mess with the line!):
