                         YOUR INSTRUCTIONS

This file contains your favorite websites!  I've included some samples,
but you should change this and make it your own.

Categories start with "&&" whereas websites are prefaced with "--".  For
your convenience, category names are not case-sensitive and will ignore
whitespace, as I have illustrated.  Each website must have its own line.

You can use multiple category names separated by semicolons (;) to assign
websites to multiple groups.  Anything marked with "default" will open if
no tags are specified.  In the sample list, the program will by default
open the "NEWS" and "EMAIL" groups.

Put your websites down here:

&& NEWS; DEFAULT; MORNING
--www.news.google.com
--http://nytimes.com

&& NEWS
(This is interesting, but I only want it to pop up when I ask
check_everything to display the news. I don't want to see it
in the morning, or by default.)
